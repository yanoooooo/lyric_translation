If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands
If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands
If you're happy and you know it, then your face will surely show it
If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands

Hot cross buns
Hot cross buns
One a penny, two a penny,
Hot cross buns
If you have no daughters,
Give them to your sons,
One a penny, two a penny,
Hot cross buns

The itsy bitsy spider
Crawled up the water spout
Down came the rain
And washed the spider out
Out came
the sun
And dried up all the rain
And the itsy bitsy spider
Crawled up the spout again

London Bridge is falling down
Falling down, falling down
London Bridge is falling down
My fair lady

Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob tails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to laugh and sing
A sleighing song tonight
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things
Cream colored ponies and crisp apple streudels
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things
Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things
When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel
so bad

It's over now I know inside
No one must ever know.
The sorry tale of Edward Hyde,
And those who died,
no one must ever know.
They'd only see the tragedy;
They'd not see my intent.
The shadow of Hyde's evil
Would forever kill the good,
That I had meant.
Am I a good man?
Am I a mad man?
It's such a fine line
between a good man and Hyde...
Do you really think,
That I would ever let you go?
Do you think,
That I'd ever set you free?
If you do,
I'm sad to say,
It simply isn't so.
You will never get away
from me!
All that you are is a face in the mirror!
I close my eyes and you'll disappear!
I'm what you face When you face in the mirror!
Long as you live, I will still be here!
All that you are Is the end of a nightmare!
All that you are is a dying scream!
After tonight, I shall end this demon dream!
This is not a dream, my friend
And it will never end!
This one is the nightmare
That goes on!
Hyde is here to stay,
No matter what you may pretend
And he'll flourish, long after you're gone!
Soon you will die, And my memory will hide you!
You cannot choose but to lose control!
You can't control me! I live deep inside you!
Each day you'll feel me devour your soul!
I don't need you to survive, like you need me!
I'll become whole As you dance with death!
And I'll rejoice As you breathe your final breath!
I'll live inside you forever!
No!
With Satan himself by my side!
No!
And I know that, now and forever,
They'll never be able to
separate Jekyll from Hyde!
Can't you see
It's over now?
It's time to die!
No, not I! Only you!
If I die,
You'll die, too!
You'll die in me,
I'll be you!
Damn you, Hyde!
leave me be!
Can't you see?
You are me!
No!
Deep inside-!
I am you!
You are Hyde!
No Never!
Yes, forever!

I hope you're happy!
I hope you're happy now.
I hope you're happy how you Hurt your cause forever!
I hope you think you're clever!
I hope you're happy!
I hope you're happy, too.
I hope you're proud how you Would grovel in submission
To feed your own ambition.
So though I can't imagine how,
I hope you're happy,
right now.
You can still be with the Wizard,
What you've worked and waited for.
You can have all you ever wanted.
But I don't want it.
No,
I can't want it
anymore.
Something has changed within me.
Something is not the same.
I'm through with playing by the rules Of someone else's game.
Too late for second-guessing.
Too late to go back to sleep.
It's time to trust my instincts.
Close my eyes
and leap.
It's time to try Defying gravity.
I think I'll try Defying gravity,
And you can't pull me down.
Can't I make you understand
You're having delusions of grandeur?
I'm through accepting limits,
'Cuz someone says they're so.
Some things I cannot change,
But till I try I'll never know.
Too long I've been afraid of
Loosing love I guess I've lost.
Well, if that's love,
It comes at
much to high a cost!
I'd sooner buy
Defying gravity
Kiss me goodbye!
I'm defying gravity,
And you can't pull me down.
Unlimited.
Together we're
unlimited.
Together we'll be the greatest team
There's ever been Glinda,
dreams the way we planned them.
If we work in tandem...
There's no fight we cannot win.
Just you and I defying gravity!
With you and I, defying gravity,
They'll never bring us down.
I hope you're happy,
now that you're choosing this.
I hope it brings you bliss.
I really hope you get it,
And you don't live to regret it.
I hope you're happy in the end.
I hope you're happy,
my friend.
So if you care to find me
Look to the western sky.
As someone told me lately:
"Ev'ryone deserves the chance to fly!"
And if I'm flying solo,
At least I'm flying free.
To those who'd ground me,
Take a message back from me:
Tell them how I'm Defying gravity!
I'm flying high, Defying gravity!
And soon I'll match them in renown.
And nobody
in all of Oz,
No Wizard that there is or was,
Is ever gonna bring
me down!
I hope you're happy.
Bring me down!

There was a time when men were kind
When their voices were soft
And their words inviting
There was a time when love was blind
And the world was a song
And the song was exciting
There was a time
Then it all went wrong
I dreamed a dream in time gone by
When hope was high
And life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving
Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung, no wine untasted
But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
As they turn your dream to shame
He slept a summer by my side
He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride
But he was gone when autumn came
And still I dream he'll come to me
That we will live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather
I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I'm living
So different now from what it seemed
Now life has killed
the dream I dreamed.

Such a feelin’s comin’ over me
There is wonder in most everything I see
Not a cloud in the sky
Got the sun in my eyes
And I won’t be surprised if it’s a dream
Everything I want the world to be
Is now coming true especially for me
And the reason is clear
It’s because you are here
You’re the nearest thing to heaven that I’ve seen
I’m on the top of the world lookin’
Down on creation and the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I’ve found　ever since you’ve been around
Your love’s put me at the top of the world

Are you going to Scarborough Fair
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine
Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
deep forest green
Parsley sage rosemary and thyme
Without no seams nor needle work
blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain
Then she'll be a true love of mine
sleeps unaware of the clarion call
Tell her to find me an acre of land
a sprinkling of leaves
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
washes the grave with silvery tears
Between the salt water and the sea strand
A soldier cleans and polishes a gun
She'll be a true love of mine

What is this feeling Of power and drive
I've never known?
I feel alive!
Where does this feeling Of power derive,
Making me know
Why I'm alive?
Like the night, it's a secret,
Sinister dark and unknown.
I do not know what I seek, Yet
I'll seek it alone!
I have a thirst That I cannot deprive.
Never have I
felt so alive!
There is no battle I couldn't survive
Feeling like this
Feeling alive!
Like the moon, an enigma,
Lost and alone in the night
Damned by some heavenly stigma,
But blazing with light!
It's the feeling of being alive!
Filled with evil, but truly alive!
It's the truth that cannot be denied!
It's the feeling of
being Edward Hyde!

You think I'm an ignorant savage
And you've been so many places
I guess it must be so
But still I cannot see
If the savage one is me
How can there be so much that you don't know?
You don't know
You think you own whatever land you land on
The Earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know every rock and tree and creature
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name
You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew
Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned?
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountains?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sunsweet berries of the Earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once, never wonder what they're worth
The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other
In a circle, in a hoop that never ends
How high does the sycamore grow?
If you cut it down, then you'll never know
And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountains
We need to paint with all the colors of the wind
You can own the Earth and still
All you'll own is Earth until
You can paint with all the colors of the wind

You’re in my arms
And all the world is calm
The music playing on for only two
So close together
And when I’m with you
So close to feeling alive
A life goes by
Romantic dreams will stop
So I bid mine goodbye and never knew
So close was waiting, waiting here with you
And now forever I know
All that I wanted to hold you
So close
So close to reaching that famous happy end
Almost believing this was not pretend
And now you’re beside me and look how far we’ve come
So far we are so close
How could I face the faceless days
If I should lose you now?
We’re so close
To reaching that famous happy end
And almost believing this was not pretend
Let’s go on dreaming for we know we are
So close
So close
And still so far

Think of me, think of me fondly,
when we've said goodbye.
Remember me once in a while
please promise me you'll try.
When you find that, once again, you long
to take your heart back and be free
if you ever find a moment,
spare a thought for me
We never said our love was evergreen,
or as unchanging as the sea
but if you can still remember
stop and think of me
Think of all the things
we've shared and seen
don't think about the way things
might have been
Think of me, think of me waking,
silent and resigned.
Imagine me, trying too hard
to put you from my mind.
Recall those days
look back on all those times,
think of the things we'll never do
there will never be a day,
when I won't think of you

The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen 
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well, now they know
Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care what they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway
It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free
Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand and here I stay
Let the storm rage on
My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the past
Let it go, let it go and
I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand in the light of day
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway

There's a grief that can't be spoken.
There's a pain goes on and on.
Empty chairs at empty tables
Now my friends are dead and gone.
Here they talked of revolution.
Here it was they lit the flame.
Here they sang about `tomorrow'
And tomorrow never came.
From the table in the corner
They could see a world reborn
And they rose with voices ringing
I can hear them now!
The very words that they had sung
Became their last communion
On the lonely barricade at dawn.
Oh my friends, my friends forgive me
That I live and you are gone.
There's a grief that can't be spoken.
There's a pain goes on and on.
Phantom faces at the window.
Phantom shadows on the floor.
Empty chairs at empty tables
Where my friends will meet no more.
Oh my friends, my friends, don't ask me
What your sacrifice was for
Empty chairs at empty tables
Where my friends will sing no more

This is the moment!
This is the day,
When I send all my doubts and demons
On their way!
Every endeavor,
I have made ever
Is coming into play,
Is here and now today!
This is the moment,
This is the time,
When the momentum and the moment
Are in rhyme!
Give me this moment
This precious chance
I'll gather up my past
And make some sense at last!
This is the moment,
When all I've done
All the dreaming,
Scheming and screaming,
Become one!
This is the day
See it sparkle and shine,
When all I've lived for
Becomes mine!
For all these years,
I've faced the world alone,
And now the time has come
To prove to them
I've made it on my own!
This is the moment
My final test
Destiny beckoned,
I never reckoned,
Second Best!
I won't look down,
I must not fall!
This is the moment,
The sweetest moment of them all!
This is the moment!
Damn all the odds!
This day, or never,
I'll sit forever
With the gods!
When I look back,
I will always recall,
Moment for moment,
This was the moment,
The greatest moment
Of them all!

Someday
When we are wiser
When the world's older
When we have learned
I pray
Someday we may yet live
To live and let live
Someday
Life will be fairer
Need will be rarer
Greed will not pay
God speed
This bright millenium
On its way
Let it come
Someday
Someday
Our fight will be won then
We'll stand in the sun then
That bright afternoon
Till then
On days when the sun is gone
We'll hang on
Wish upon the moon
There are some days dark and bitter
Seems we haven't got a prayer
But a prayer for someday better
Is the one thing we all share
Someday
Life will be fairer
Need will be rarer
Greed wil not pay
God speed
This bright millenium
Let it come
Wish upon the moon
One day
Someday
Soon.

Safe behind these windows and these parapets of stone
Gazing at the people down below me
All my life I watch them as I hide up here alone
Hungry for the histories they show me
All my life I memorize their faces
Knowing them as they will never know me
All my life I wonder how it feels to pass a day
Not above them
But part of them
And out there
Living in the sun
Give me one day out there
All I ask is one
To hold forever
Out there
Where they all live unaware
What I'd give
What I'd dare
Just to live one day out there
Out there among the millers and the weavers and their wives
Through the roofs and gables I can see them
Ev'ry day they shout and scold and go about their lives
Heedless of the gift it is to be them
If I was in their skin
I'd treasure ev'ry instant
Out there
Strolling by the Seine
Taste a morning out there
Like ordinary men
Who freely walk about there
Just one day and then
I swear I'll be content
With my share
Won't resent
Won't despair
Old and bent
I won't care
I'll have spent
One day
Out there

On my own
Pretending he's beside me
All alone
I walk with him till morning
Without him
I feel his arms around me
And when I lose my way I close my eyes
And he has found me
In the rain
the pavement shines like silver
All the lights are misty in the river
In the darkness
the trees are full of starlight
And all I see is him and me forever and forever
And I know
it's only in my mind
That I'm talking to myself and not to him
And although
I know that he is blind
Still I say
there's a way for us
I love him
But when the night is over
He is gone
The river's just a river
Without him
The world around me changes
The trees are bare and everywhere
The streets are full of strangers
I love him
But every day I'm learning
All my life
I've only been pretending
Without me
His world will go on turning
A world that's full of happiness
That I have never known
I love him
I love him
I love him
But only on my own

La la lu, La la lu
Oh, my little star sweeper
I'll sweep the stardust for you
La la lu, La la lu
Little soft fluffy sleeper
Here comes a pink cloud for you
La la lu, La la lu
Little wandering angel
Fold up your wings close your eyes
La la lu, La la lu
And may love be your keeper
La la lu, La la lu, La la lu

Oh this is the night
it's a beautiful night
And we call it bella notte
Look at the skies
they have stars in their eyes
On this lovely bella notte.
Side by side with your loved one,
You'll find enchantment here.
The night will weave its magic spell,
When the one you love is near
Oh this is the night, and the heavens are right
On this lovely bella notte

Look at this stuff
Isn't it neat
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl
The girl who has everything
Look at this trove
Treasures untold
How many wonders can one cavern hold
Looking around here you think
Sure, she's got everything
I've got gadgets and gizmos a-plenty
I've got whozits and whatzits galore
You want things of above
I've got twenty
But who cares
No big deal
I want more
I wanna be where the people are
I wanna see
wanna see them dancing'
Walking around on
those what do you call 'em
Oh feet
Flippin' your fins, you don't get too far
Legs are required for jumping, dancing
Strolling along down
a what's that word again
Street
Up where they walk
up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wanderin' free wish
I could be
Part of that world
What would I give if I could live out of these waters
What would I pay to spend a day warm on the sand
Bet'cha on land they understand
Bet they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright young women sick of swimming
Ready to stand
And ready to know what the people know
Ask 'em my questions and get some answers
What's a fire and why does it what's the word
Burn
When's it my turn
Wouldn't I love
love to explore that shore up above
Out of the sea
Wish I could be
Part of that world

When I meet the Wizard
Once I prove my worth
And then I meet the Wizard
What I've waited for since since birth
And with all his Wizard wisdom
By my looks, he won't be blinded
Do you think the Wizard is dumb?
Or, like Munchkins, so small-minded?
No He'll say to me,
"I see who you truly are
A girl on whom I can rely"
And that's how we'll begin
The Wizard and I
Once I'm with the Wizard
My whole life will change
'Cause once you're with the Wizard
No one thinks you're strange
No father is not proud of you,
No sister acts ashamed
And all of Oz has to love you
When by the Wizard you're acclaimed
And this gift or this curse
I have inside
Maybe at last, I'll know why
When we are hand and hand
The Wizard and I
And one day, he'll say to me, Elphaba,
A girl who is so superior
Shouldn't a girl who's so good inside
Have a matching exterior?
And since folks here to an absurd degree
Seem fixated on your verdigris
Would it be all right by you
If I de-greenify you
And though of course
That's not important to me
All right, why not? I'll reply
Oh, what a pair we'll be
The Wizard and I
Yes, what a pair we'll be
The Wizard and
Unlimited
My future is unlimited
And I've just had a vision
Almost like a prophecy
I know it sounds truly crazy
And true, the vision's hazy
But I swear, someday there'll be
A celebration throughout Oz
That's all to do with me
And I'll stand there with the Wizard
Feeling things I've never felt
And though I'd never show it
I'll be so happy, I could melt
And so it will be
For the rest of my life
And I'll want nothing else
Till I die
Held in such high esteem
When people see me, they will scream
For half of Oz's fav'rite team
The Wizard
And I

Days can be sunny with never a sigh
Don't need what money can buy
Birds in the trees sing their dayful of songs
Why shouldn't we sing along
I'm chipper all the day
Happy with my lot
How do I get that way
Look at what I've got
I got rhythm
I got music
I got my man
Who could ask for anything more
I've got daisies in green pastures
I've got my man
Who could ask for anything more
Old man trouble I don't mind him
You won't find him 'round my door
I've got starlight
I've got sweet dreams
I've got my man
Who could ask for anything more
Who could ask for anything more

From the day we arrive on the planet
And, blinking, step into the sun
There's more to see than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done
There's far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rolling high
Through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round
It's the circle of life
And it moves us all
Through despair and hope
Through faith and love
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle
The circle of life
It's the circle of life
And it moves us all
Through despair and hope
Through faith and love
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle
The circle of life

Alas, my love, you do me wrong,
To cast me off discourteously.
For I have loved you so long,
Delighting in your company.
Greensleeves was all my joy
Greensleeves was my delight,
Greensleeves was my heart of gold,
And who but my lady greensleeves.

Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly
Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the beast
Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before and ever just as sure as the sun will rise
Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bitter sweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong
Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the beast
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the beast

It's over now I know inside
No one must ever know.
The sorry tale of Edward Hyde,
And those who died, no one must ever know.
They'd only see the tragedy;
They'd not see my intent.
The shadow of Hyde's evil
Would forever kill the good,
That I had meant.
Am I a good man?
Am I a mad man?
It's such a fine line between a good man and Hyde...
Do you really think,
That I would ever let you go?
Do you think,
That I'd ever set you free?
If you do, I'm sad to say,
It simply isn't so.
You will never get away from me!
All that you are
Is a face in the mirror!
I close my eyes and you'll disappear!
I'm what you face
When you face in the mirror!
Long as you live, I will still be here!
All that you are
Is the end of a nightmare!
All that you are is a dying scream!
After tonight,
I shall end this demon dream!
This is not a dream, my friend
And it will never end!
This one is the nightmare
That goes on!
Hyde is here to stay,
No matter what you may pretend
And he'll flourish, long after you're gone!
Soon you will die,
And my memory will hide you!
You cannot choose but to lose control!
You can't control me!
I live deep inside you!
Each day you'll feel me devour your soul!
I don't need you to survive,
like you need me!
I'll become whole
As you dance with death!
And I'll rejoice
As you breathe your final breath!
I'll live inside you forever!
No!
With Satan himself by my side!
No!
And I know that, now and forever,
They'll never be able to separate
Jekyll from Hyde!
Can't you see
It's over now?
It's time to die!
No, not I!
Only you!
If I die,
You'll die, too!
You'll die in me,
I'll be you!
Damn you, Hyde!
leave me be!
Can't you see?
You are me!
No!
Deep inside-!
I am you!
You are Hyde!
No - Never!
Yes, forever!
God damn you, Hyde!
Take all your evil deeds,
And rot in hell!
I'll see you there, Jekyll!

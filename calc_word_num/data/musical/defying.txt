I hope you're happy!
I hope you're happy now.
I hope you're happy how you 
Hurt your cause forever!
I hope you think you're clever!
I hope you're happy!
I hope you're happy, too.
I hope you're proud how you 
Would grovel in submission 
To feed your own ambition.
So though I can't imagine how,
I hope you're happy, right now.
You can still be with the Wizard,
What you've worked and waited for. 
You can have all you ever wanted.
But I don't want it.
No, I can't want it anymore.
Something has changed within me.
Something is not the same.
I'm through with playing by the rules 
Of someone else's game.
Too late for second-guessing.
Too late to go back to sleep.
It's time to trust my instincts. 
Close my eyes and leap.
It's time to try 
Defying gravity.
I think I'll try
Defying gravity, 
And you can't pull me down.
Can't I make you understand
You're having delusions of grandeur?
I'm through accepting limits,
'Cuz someone says they're so.
Some things I cannot change,
But till I try I'll never know.
Too long I've been afraid of 
Loosing love I guess I've lost.
Well, if that's love, 
It comes at much to high a cost!
I'd sooner buy 
Defying gravity
Kiss me goodbye!
I'm defying gravity, 
And you can't pull me down.
Unlimited. 
Together we're unlimited. 
Together we'll be the greatest team 
There's ever been. 
Glinda, dreams the way we planned them.
If we work in tandem...
There's no fight we cannot win.
Just you and I defying gravity!
With you and I, defying gravity, 
They'll never bring us down.
I hope you're happy, now that you're choosing this.
I hope it brings you bliss.
I really hope you get it, 
And you don't live to regret it.
I hope you're happy in the end.
I hope you're happy, my friend.
So if you care to find me
Look to the western sky.
As someone told me lately:
"Ev'ryone deserves the chance to fly!"
And if I'm flying solo,
At least I'm flying free.
To those who'd ground me,
Take a message back from me:
Tell them how I'm
Defying gravity!
I'm flying high,
Defying gravity!
And soon I'll match them in renown.
And nobody in all of Oz,
No Wizard that there is or was,
Is ever gonna bring me down!
I hope you're happy.
Bring me down!

london bridge is falling down
falling down falling down
london bridge is falling down 
my fair lady
if you're happy and you know it clap your hands
if you're happy and you know it clap your hands
if you're happy and you know it then your face will surely show it
if you're happy and you know it clap your hands
this is the moment
this is the day
when i send all my doubts and demons
on their way
every endeavor
i have made ever
is coming into play
is here and now today
this is the moment
this is the time
when the momentum and the moment
are in rhyme
give me this moment
this precious chance
i'll gather up my past
and make some sense at last
this is the moment
when all i've done
all the dreaming
scheming and screaming
become one
this is the day
see it sparkle and shine
when all i've lived for
becomes mine
for all these years
i've faced the world alone
and now the time has come
to prove to them
i've made it on my own
this is the moment
my final test
destiny beckoned
i never reckoned
second best
i won't look down
i must not fall
this is the moment
the sweetest moment of them all
this is the moment
damn all the odds
this day or never
i'll sit forever
with the gods
when i look back
i will always recall
moment for moment
this was the moment
the greatest moment
of them all
there's a grief that can't be spoken
there's a pain goes on and on
empty chairs at empty tables
now my friends are dead and gone
here they talked of revolution
here it was they lit the flame
here they sang about tomorrow
and tomorrow never came
from the table in the corner
they could see a world reborn
and they rose with voices ringing
i can hear them now
the very words that they had sung
became their last communion
on the lonely barricade at dawn
oh my friends my friends forgive me
that i live and you are gone
there's a grief that can't be spoken
there's a pain goes on and on
phantom faces at the window
phantom shadows on the floor
empty chairs at empty tables
where my friends will meet no more
oh my friends my friends don't ask me
what your sacrifice was for
empty chairs at empty tables
where my friends will sing no more
the snow glows white on the mountain tonight
not a footprint to be seen
a kingdom of isolation
and it looks like i'm the queen 
the wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
couldn't keep it in heaven knows i've tried
don't let them in don't let them see
be the good girl you always have to be
conceal don't feel don't let them know
well now they know
let it go let it go
can't hold it back anymore
let it go let it go
turn away and slam the door
i don't care what they're going to say
let the storm rage on
the cold never bothered me anyway
it's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
and the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all
it's time to see what i can do
to test the limits and break through
no right no wrong no rules for me
i'm free
let it go let it go
i am one with the wind and sky
let it go let it go
you'll never see me cry
here i stand and here i stay
let the storm rage on
my power flurries through the air into the ground
my soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
and one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
i'm never going back the past is in the past
let it go let it go and
i'll rise like the break of dawn
let it go let it go
that perfect girl is gone
here i stand in the light of day
let the storm rage on
the cold never bothered me anyway
raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
bright copper kettles and warm woollen mittens
brown paper packages tied up with strings
these are a few of my favorite things
cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels
doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
these are a few of my favorite things
girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
silver white winters that melt into springs
these are a few of my favorite things
when the dog bites when the bee stings
when i'm feeling sad
i simply remember my favorite things
and then i don't feel so bad
think of me think of me fondly
when we've said goodbye
remember me once in a while
please promise me you'll try
when you find that once again you long
to take your heart back and be free
if you ever find a moment
spare a thought for me
we never said our love was evergreen
or as unchanging as the sea
but if you can still remember
stop and think of me
think of all the things
we've shared and seen
don't think about the way things
might have been
think of me think of me waking
silent and resigned
imagine me trying too hard
to put you from my mind
recall those days
look back on all those times
think of the things we'll never do
there will never be a day
when i won't think of you
you’re in my arms
and all the world is calm
the music playing on for only two
so close together
and when i’m with you
so close to feeling alive
a life goes by
romantic dreams will stop
so i bid mine goodbye and never knew
so close was waiting waiting here with you
and now forever i know
all that i wanted to hold you
so close
so close to reaching that famous happy end
almost believing this was not pretend
and now you’re beside me and look how far we’ve come
so far we are so close
how could i face the faceless days
if i should lose you now
we’re so close
to reaching that famous happy end
and almost believing this was not pretend
let’s go on dreaming for we know we are
so close
so close
and still so far
you think i'm an ignorant savage
and you've been so many places
i guess it must be so
but still i cannot see
if the savage one is me
how can there be so much that you don't know
you don't know
you think you own whatever land you land on
the earth is just a dead thing you can claim
but i know every rock and tree and creature
has a life has a spirit has a name
you think the only people who are people
are the people who look and think like you
but if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
you'll learn things you never knew you never knew
have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned
can you sing with all the voices of the mountains
can you paint with all the colors of the wind
can you paint with all the colors of the wind
come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
come taste the sunsweet berries of the earth
come roll in all the riches all around you
and for once never wonder what they're worth
the rainstorm and the river are my brothers
the heron and the otter are my friends
and we are all connected to each other
in a circle in a hoop that never ends
how high does the sycamore grow
if you cut it down then you'll never know
and you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
for whether we are white or copper skinned
we need to sing with all the voices of the mountains
we need to paint with all the colors of the wind
you can own the earth and still
all you'll own is earth until
you can paint with all the colors of the wind
dashing through the snow
in a one horse open sleigh
o'er the fields we go
laughing all the way
bells on bob tails ring
making spirits bright
what fun it is to laugh and sing
a sleighing song tonight
oh jingle bells jingle bells
jingle all the way
oh what fun it is to ride
in a one horse open sleigh
jingle bells jingle bells
jingle all the way
oh what fun it is to ride
in a one horse open sleigh
someday
when we are wiser
when the world's older
when we have learned
i pray
someday we may yet live
to live and let live
someday
life will be fairer
need will be rarer
greed will not pay
god speed
this bright millenium
on its way
let it come
someday
someday
our fight will be won then
we'll stand in the sun then
that bright afternoon
till then
on days when the sun is gone
we'll hang on
wish upon the moon
there are some days dark and bitter
seems we haven't got a prayer
but a prayer for someday better
is the one thing we all share
someday
life will be fairer
need will be rarer
greed wil not pay
god speed
this bright millenium
let it come
wish upon the moon
one day
someday
soon
safe behind these windows and these parapets of stone
gazing at the people down below me
all my life i watch them as i hide up here alone
hungry for the histories they show me
all my life i memorize their faces
knowing them as they will never know me
all my life i wonder how it feels to pass a day
not above them
but part of them
and out there
living in the sun
give me one day out there
all i ask is one
to hold forever
out there
where they all live unaware
what i'd give
what i'd dare
just to live one day out there
out there among the millers and the weavers and their wives
through the roofs and gables i can see them
ev'ry day they shout and scold and go about their lives
heedless of the gift it is to be them
if i was in their skin
i'd treasure ev'ry instant
out there
strolling by the seine
taste a morning out there
like ordinary men
who freely walk about there
just one day and then
i swear i'll be content
with my share
won't resent
won't despair
old and bent
i won't care
i'll have spent one day out there
there was a time when men were kind
when their voices were soft
and their words inviting
there was a time when love was blind
and the world was a song
and the song was exciting
there was a time
then it all went wrong
i dreamed a dream in time gone by
when hope was high
and life worth living
i dreamed that love would never die
i dreamed that god would be forgiving
then i was young and unafraid
and dreams were made and used and wasted
there was no ransom to be paid
no song unsung no wine untasted
but the tigers come at night
with their voices soft as thunder
as they tear your hope apart
as they turn your dream to shame
he slept a summer by my side
he filled my days with endless wonder
he took my childhood in his stride
but he was gone when autumn came
and still i dream he'll come to me
that we will live the years together
but there are dreams that cannot be
and there are storms we cannot weather
i had a dream my life would be
so different from this hell i'm living
so different now from what it seemed
now life has killed
the dream i dreamed
all those days watching from the windows
all those years outside looking in
all that time never even knowing
just how blind i've been
now i'm here blinking in the starlight
now i'm here suddenly i see
standing here
it's all so clear
i'm where i'm meant to be
and at last i see the light
and it's like the fog has lifted
and at last i see the light
and it's like the sky is new
and it's warm and real and bright
and the world has somehow shifted
all at once everything looks different
now that i see you
all those days chasing down a daydream
all those years living in a blur
all that time never truly seeing
things the way they were
now she's here shining in the starlight
now she's here suddenly i know
if she's here
it's crystal clear
i'm where i'm meant to go
and at last i see the light
and it's like the fog has lifted
and at last i see the light
and it's like the sky is new
and it's warm and real and bright
and the world has somehow shifted
all at once everything is different
now that i see you
now that i see you
on my own
pretending he's beside me
all alone
i walk with him till morning
without him
i feel his arms around me
and when i lose my way i close my eyes
and he has found me
in the rain
the pavement shines like silver
all the lights are misty in the river
in the darkness
the trees are full of starlight
and all i see is him and me forever and forever
and i know
it's only in my mind
that i'm talking to myself and not to him
and although
i know that he is blind
still i say
there's a way for us
i love him
but when the night is over
he is gone
the river's just a river
without him
the world around me changes
the trees are bare and everywhere
the streets are full of strangers
i love him
but every day i'm learning
all my life
i've only been pretending
without me
his world will go on turning
a world that's full of happiness
that i have never known
i love him
i love him
i love him
but only on my own
la la lu la la lu
oh my little star sweeper
i'll sweep the stardust for you
la la lu la la lu
little soft fluffy sleeper
here comes a pink cloud for you
la la lu la la lu
little wandering angel
fold up your wings close your eyes
la la lu la la lu
and may love be your keeper
la la lu la la lu la la lu
oh this is the night
it's a beautiful night
and we call it bella notte
look at the skies
they have stars in their eyes
on this lovely bella notte
side by side with your loved one
you'll find enchantment here
the night will weave its magic spell
when the one you love is near
oh this is the night and the heavens are right
on this lovely bella notte
look at this stuff
isn't it neat
wouldn't you think my collection's complete
wouldn't you think i'm the girl
the girl who has everything
look at this trove
treasures untold
how many wonders can one cavern hold
looking around here you think
sure she's got everything
i've got gadgets and gizmos a-plenty
i've got whozits and whatzits galore
you want things of above
i've got twenty
but who cares
no big deal
i want more
i wanna be where the people are
i wanna see
wanna see them dancing'
walking around on
those what do you call 'em
oh feet
flippin' your fins you don't get too far
legs are required for jumping dancing
strolling along down
a what's that word again
street
up where they walk
up where they run
up where they stay all day in the sun
wanderin' free wish
i could be
part of that world
what would i give if i could live out of these waters
what would i pay to spend a day warm on the sand
bet'cha on land they understand
bet they don't reprimand their daughters
bright young women sick of swimming
ready to stand
and ready to know what the people know
ask 'em my questions and get some answers
what's a fire and why does it what's the word burn
when's it my turn
wouldn't i love
love to explore that shore up above
out of the sea
wish i could be
part of that world
when i meet the wizard
once i prove my worth
and then i meet the wizard
what i've waited for since since birth
and with all his wizard wisdom
by my looks he won't be blinded
do you think the wizard is dumb
or like munchkins so small-minded
no he'll say to me
i see who you truly are
a girl on whom i can rely
and that's how we'll begin
the wizard and i
once i'm with the wizard
my whole life will change
'cause once you're with the wizard
no one thinks you're strange
no father is not proud of you
no sister acts ashamed
and all of oz has to love you
when by the wizard you're acclaimed
and this gift or this curse
i have inside
maybe at last i'll know why
when we are hand and hand
the wizard and i
and one day he'll say to me elphaba
a girl who is so superior
shouldn't a girl who's so good inside
have a matching exterior
and since folks here to an absurd degree
seem fixated on your verdigris
would it be all right by you
if i de-greenify you
and though of course
that's not important to me
all right why not i'll reply
oh what a pair we'll be
the wizard and i
yes what a pair we'll be
the wizard and
unlimited
my future is unlimited
and i've just had a vision
almost like a prophecy
i know it sounds truly crazy
and true the vision's hazy
but i swear someday there'll be
a celebration throughout oz
that's all to do with me
and i'll stand there with the wizard
feeling things i've never felt
and though i'd never show it
i'll be so happy i could melt
and so it will be
for the rest of my life
and i'll want nothing else
till i die
held in such high esteem
when people see me they will scream
for half of oz's fav'rite team
the wizard
and i
days can be sunny with never a sigh
don't need what money can buy
birds in the trees sing their dayful of songs
why shouldn't we sing along
i'm chipper all the day
happy with my lot
how do i get that way
look at what i've got
i got rhythm
i got music
i got my man
who could ask for anything more
i've got daisies in green pastures
i've got my man
who could ask for anything more
old man trouble i don't mind him
you won't find him 'round my door
i've got starlight
i've got sweet dreams
i've got my man
who could ask for anything more
who could ask for anything more
from the day we arrive on the planet
and blinking step into the sun
there's more to see than can ever be seen
more to do than can ever be done
there's far too much to take in here
more to find than can ever be found
but the sun rolling high
through the sapphire sky
keeps great and small on the endless round
it's the circle of life
and it moves us all
through despair and hope
through faith and love
till we find our place
on the path unwinding
in the circle
the circle of life
it's the circle of life
and it moves us all
through despair and hope
through faith and love
till we find our place
on the path unwinding
in the circle
the circle of life
alas my love you do me wrong
to cast me off discourteously
for i have loved you so long
delighting in your company
greensleeves was all my joy
greensleeves was my delight
greensleeves was my heart of gold
and who but my lady greensleeves
tale as old as time
true as it can be
barely even friends
then somebody bends
unexpectedly
just a little change
small to say the least
both a little scared
neither one prepared
beauty and the beast
ever just the same
ever a surprise
ever as before and ever just as sure as the sun will rise
tale as old as time
tune as old as song
bitter sweet and strange
finding you can change
learning you were wrong
certain as the sun
rising in the east
tale as old as time
song as old as rhyme
beauty and the beast
tale as old as time
song as old as rhyme
beauty and the beast
